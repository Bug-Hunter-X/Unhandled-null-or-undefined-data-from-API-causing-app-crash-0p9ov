# Unhandled Null or Undefined Data from API

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native applications where fetching data from an API can lead to crashes if the response is null, undefined, or lacks expected properties. The provided code examples illustrate the bug and its solution.

## Bug Description

A React Native component fetches data from a remote API. If the API response is null, undefined, or missing a property accessed in the component, the application crashes with a runtime error.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking for null or undefined values before accessing properties. Conditional rendering is used to display appropriate messages when data is loading or an error occurs.  Additional error handling is implemented to gracefully handle API request failures.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`).
4. Observe the app behavior.  The original buggy code will crash, while the solution will display appropriate messages depending on the API response.
